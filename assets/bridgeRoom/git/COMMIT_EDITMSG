I broke the bottom of the vase whilst putting it on the button. The
water is leaking everywhere, but not enough is getting to the fire to
extinguish it.

The button is staying pressed even while it loses its water contents.
Perhaps I could have put out the fire and then place the empty vase on
the button?

Not that it matters now....
