Well, the fire's out and the button is pressed, so the bridge is raised.

The problem is I'm stuck here standing on the button.

Taking the vase off the button caused it to unpress, and that relowered
the bridge. So, I stood on the button as I raised the vase off of it,
keeping the button pressed.

I threw the vase of water at the fire. There was an explosion of glass
shattering and steam bubbling, and that kssssh of fire extinguishing.
The fire is out and the bridge is right there, but this button needs to
be pressed for the bridge to stay raised.

I'm simply too fat to run across that bridge before it lowers. Me and my
stupid love of "Frozen"-brand fruit snacks.
